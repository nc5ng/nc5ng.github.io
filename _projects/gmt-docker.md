Docker images can provide a convenient way to evaluate development versions of tools without needing to pollute the local system with complex build requirements. 

nc5ng maintains precompiled images with latest Trunk GMT code, Up to date DCW Boundary Data and GSHHG  Coastal Data

More information can be found at the [github page](https://www.github.com/nc5ng/gmt-docker) and on the dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/nc5ng/gmt/

Additional convenience images with python (and gmt-python) as well as jupyter python notebook are also available.
