`nc5ng` was started as a project in Nov. 2017 to bring North American Datum Conversion tools to a broader developer audience. With a focus on historic datums for use with Historical Topographic maps, the US Standard Datum (`USSD`) in particular. 

Initially the project is focused on documentation and updating the build pipeline. Documenting the command flow and internal datastructures is a pre-requisite for any further work on the code base.

The Next Goal for the Project is to adapt the existing code to make it suitable for use as a stand-alone tool  in Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment Data Processing Pipelines.

This project is inspired by the [NADCON](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Nadcon/Nadcon.shtml) and [GEOCON](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOCON/)  project at the US National Geodetic Survey. The initial design of the project is based on the [NADCON5.0 Code Base](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NADCON5/index.shtml)
